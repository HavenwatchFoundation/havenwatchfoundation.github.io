Havenwatch Foundation for Child Protection is a **volunteer-based child safety organization** focused on identifying, documenting, and responsibly reporting online harms involving minors. This repository supports the public-facing website and provides transparent access to our core governance documents, operational principles, and organizational structure.

We are currently in the process of transitioning toward a **formal non-profit structure**, with an emphasis on accountability, lawful conduct, evidence integrity, and responsible collaboration.

## About Havenwatch

Havenwatch operates as a structured volunteer organization dedicated to online child protection efforts. Our work centers on:

- Receiving and reviewing reports related to online child exploitation risks  
- Documenting digital evidence in a structured and responsible manner  
- Coordinating internal review across operational, legal, and analytical teams  
- Submitting reports to appropriate platforms, hotlines, or partner organizations when applicable  

Havenwatch is **not a law enforcement agency** and does not replace official authorities. Our role is to act as a responsible intermediary that improves reporting quality, documentation clarity, and procedural discipline.

## Organizational Approach

Havenwatch is designed around **clear separation of duties**, controlled access, and documented workflows. This structure reduces errors, limits exposure, and ensures sensitive material is handled appropriately.

Core principles include:

- Case-based workflows with documented review stages  
- Departmental access control based on role and clearance  
- Written standards for conduct, evidence handling, and data protection  
- Volunteer participation governed by defined engagement rules  

This repository exists to provide transparency into how the organization is structured and governed.
